    "### For Developers\n",
    "If you're familiar with LLMs, you can skip to tutorial 3 and focus on AILib-specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Production Use\n",
    "Focus on tutorials 6-10, especially the real-world examples and advanced features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Tips for Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the code**: Each tutorial has executable examples. Run them and experiment!\n",
    "2. **Modify examples**: Change parameters and see what happens\n",
    "3. **Build something**: After each tutorial, try building a small project\n",
    "4. **Check the API docs**: Refer to the AILib documentation for detailed API information\n",
