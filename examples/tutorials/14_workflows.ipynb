While excessive use of social media has been linked to negative mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness, there are also positive aspects to consider. Social media can provide a sense of connection and support, and can be a valuable tool for self-expression and communication. It is important for individuals to be mindful of their social media use and to prioritize real-life interactions and self-care practices to maintain a healthy balance.\n"

      "3. Consolidate similar connections: If you have multiple API connections that serve a similar purpose, consider consolidating them into a single connection. This can help simplify your system and reduce maintenance overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Secure connections: Ensure that all API connections are secure by using appropriate authentication mechanisms, encryption, and other security measures. This will help protect your data and prevent unauthorized access.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Document connections: Document all API connections in your system, including their purpose, endpoints, authentication methods, and any other relevant information. This documentation will help you understand and manage your connections effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Monitor connections: Set up monitoring tools to track the performance and usage of your API connections. This will help you identify any issues or bottlenecks and take proactive measures to address them.\n",

      "7. Regularly review and update connections: Regularly review your API connections to ensure they are up-to-date and functioning properly. Update connections as needed to keep them optimized and secure.\n",

      "1. Close the connection: Make sure to close the connection after you have finished using it. This will release any resources that were being used by the connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Error handling: Implement proper error handling in your code to catch any exceptions that may occur during the connection process. This will help prevent any potential issues with the connection.\n",

      "3. Use connection pooling: If you are making multiple API calls, consider using connection pooling to reuse connections and minimize the overhead of creating new connections each time.\n",

      "In today's fast-paced world, finding time to relax and unwind can be a challenge. However, taking the time to prioritize self-care is crucial for our mental and physical well-being. One way to achieve this is by creating a self-care routine that suits your lifestyle and needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Start by identifying activities that help you feel relaxed and rejuvenated. This could include activities such as reading a book, going for a walk in nature, practicing yoga or meditation, or indulging in a hobby you enjoy. The key is to find activities that help you feel calm and centered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incorporating self-care into your daily routine can be as simple as setting aside a few minutes each day to practice mindfulness or relaxation techniques. This could involve deep breathing exercises, taking a short walk outside, or simply taking a moment to sit quietly and reflect on your day.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to remember that self-care is not selfish. Taking care of yourself allows you to better care for others and improves your overall well-being. By prioritizing self-care, you are investing in your mental and physical health, which will ultimately benefit you in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, make self-care a priority in your life. Take the time to create a self-care routine that works for you and stick to it. Your mind and body will thank you for it.\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic sequential workflows\n",
    "2. **Name Your Steps**: Use descriptive names for better debugging\n",
    "3. **Validate Important Data**: Use schemas for critical transformations\n",
    "4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Add retries and fallbacks\n",
    "5. **Use Parallel Execution**: For independent operations\n",
    "6. **Compose and Reuse**: Build a library of workflow components\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "AILib's workflow system provides powerful orchestration capabilities while maintaining simplicity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple API**: Start with one-liners, add complexity as needed\n",
    "- **Flexible Control Flow**: Conditions, loops, parallel execution\n",
    "- **Robust Error Handling**: Retries, fallbacks, custom handlers\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Schema validation with Pydantic\n",
    "- **Human Integration**: Approval gates and interventions\n",
    "- **Composable**: Build complex workflows from simple parts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore the [Workflow API Reference](../../docs/workflows/api-reference.md)\n",
    "- Check out [Advanced Examples](../workflow_advanced.py)\n",
